# Totally Balanced Bone Drops

If most entities have skeletons, surely they should drop bones? Of course! I see no balance issues with this!

This mod makes every entity that has a skeleton (currently a hardcoded blacklist) drop bones, with a configurable chance.

The mod is configurable via Mod Menu, with the following drop chance options:

- Very Rare: 5% chance, 1 roll.
- Rare: 10% chance, 2 rolls.
- Common: 20% chance, rolls.
- Very Common: 40% chance, 2 rolls.
- Abundant: 70% chance, 3 rolls.
